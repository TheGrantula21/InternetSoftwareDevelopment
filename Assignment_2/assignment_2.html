<body><h1>Who are you? What is your background? What CS courses have you taken? What computer languages do you know?</h1><p>I am Grant Huff. I was born in Kansas City Missouri but moved to San Antonio when I was three. I have taken all of my core computer science classes except for computer architecture and am finishing up my CS electives. I have learned C++, Java, and some javascript, html, and css.</p><h2>Why are you taking this class?</h2><p>

I am taking this class because am greatly interested in the front end and back end of web development and would love to turn this into a career someday.</p><h3>What are your interests in Computer Science?</h3><p>

My interests in computer science are web development and a slight interest in video game development.</p><h4>What is your 5 year plan?</h4><p>

In 5 years I would like to be a java developer for USAA and create web applications for their clients.</p></body></html>
