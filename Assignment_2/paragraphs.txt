I am Grant Huff. I was born in Kansas City Missouri but moved to San Antonio when I was three. I have taken all of my core computer science classes except for computer architecture and am finishing up my CS electives. I have learned C++, Java, and some javascript, html, and css. 

I am taking this class because am greatly interested in the front end and back end of web development and would love to turn this into a career someday. 

My interests in computer science are web development and a slight interest in video game development. 

In 5 years I would like to be a java developer for USAA and create web applications for their clients.
