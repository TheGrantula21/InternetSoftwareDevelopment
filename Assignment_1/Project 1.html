        <p1>I am Grant Huff. I was born in Kansas City Missouri but moved to San Antonio when I was three. I have taken all of my core computer science classes except for computer architecture and am finishing up my CS electives. I have learned C++, Java, and some javascript, html, and css.</p1>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <p2>I am taking this class because am greatly interested in the front end and back end of web development and would love to turn this into a career someday.</p2>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <p3>My interests in computer science are web development and a slight interest in video game development.</p3>

        <p4>In 5 years I would like to be a java developer for USAA and creat web applications for their clients.</p4>
